    NOTE: There could be some problems running the light stick system on a personal computer. The Kivy framework need some
    time to be set up correctly, and the MSV service is still under development. The following steps are needed to setup
    the light stick controller.

*Run the system is this order:
    1. The server need to be started first
    2. light stick controller


*** LIGHT STICK SERVER ***
    Dependencies:
        The light stick server uses the WebPy library and the MSV library both of these libraries are included in
        the "libs" folder

    To run the server:

        python \LightStick\Backend\server.py


*** LIGHT STICK CONTROLLER ***
    To Run the light stick client:

    Dependencies:
        1. kivy must be installed to run the service:
            installation instruction can be found on (The controller has only been tested for windows):
                - http://kivy.org/#download

        2. There could be some problems with setting up the python interpreter to find the kivy installation. The
           stack overflow post gives a solution used during the development of the project:

                http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9768489/kivy-eclipse-and-pydev-also-pypy


        An environment variable needs to be set for the light stick controller to find the .kv files on launch:
        The variable FILE_PATH = the full path to the LightStick/LightStickController/KivyFiles must be set

        When kivy and the env_var is set correctly the light stick controller should be able to be launched with:

            python \LightStick\LightStickController\Source\main.py


When the server and light stick controller are up and running the service should be available from local host.

To access the light stick client:
    http://localhost:8080

To access the mobile bpm controller
    http://localhost:8080/beatControl
